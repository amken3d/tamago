// These hooks act as a "Rosetta Stone" for integration of a freestanding Go
// runtime within an arbitrary environment, whether bare metal or OS supported.

// For bare metal examples see the following packages: [usbarmory], [uefi],
// [microvm].
//
// For OS supported examples see the following tamago packages: [linux],
// [applet].
//
// This package is a stub and is only used for documentation purposes,

// NumCPU is the number of hardware processors the runtime should schedule

	// Bloc is an optional variable which can be set to redefine the heap

	// receiving processor's interrupt handler is expected to notice the
	// pending request (see [runtime.preemptM]) and bring the interrupted

	// RawTicks, when set, returns a free-running microsecond-class
	// counter read with zero locks -- the deadman's clock, so its

	// counts (which race ahead by orders of magnitude in an interrupt
	// storm). Same contract as RawPutc: MUST be nosplit-safe.
	RawTicks func() uint32

	// RawPutc, when set, writes one byte to the console bypassing every

	RawPutc func(c byte)

	// IRQAck, when set, is called by the interrupt handler on the
	// relay-model core before signalling the service goroutine: the
	// platform acknowledges the sources it can handle entirely in place
	// (a periodic tick, a wake doorbell) and returns true if NOTHING is
	// left pending, in which case the handler returns with the interrupt
	// mask untouched and the service goroutine is not involved. This
	// keeps the tick -- and the time-slice fan-out riding it -- alive
	// through a stopped world, when the service goroutine cannot run.
	// Returning false takes the classic path: relay, and return masked
	// until serviced. MUST be nosplit-safe.
	IRQAck func() bool

	// DeadmanHook, when set, is called at the end of the runtime deadman's
	// dump so the platform can append its own evidence (exception
	// breadcrumbs, interrupt counters, trapped console buffers). Same
	// contract as RawPutc: nosplit-safe, no locks, no allocation.
